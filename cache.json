We\ntry to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance\nand any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual\ntokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation. To enhance visual tokens,\nwe propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution\nrefinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a\nhigh-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and\nreasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In\ngeneral, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current\nframeworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously.\nMini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs)\nfrom 2B to 34B.

While this simplicity is attractive, it is necessary to train such\nmodels on large and varied datasets, which are difficult to capture. It has\nbeen shown that using embeddings from pre-trained foundational models, such as\nCLIP, improves zero shot transfer in several applications. Taking inspiration\nfrom this, in our paper we explore the use of global image priors generated\nfrom a pre-trained ViT model to provide more detailed contextual information.\nWe argue that the embedding vector from a ViT model, pre-trained on a large\ndataset, captures greater relevant information for SIDE than the usual route of\ngenerating pseudo image captions, followed by CLIP based text embeddings. Based\non this idea, we propose a new SIDE model using a diffusion backbone which is\nconditioned on ViT embeddings.

Furthermore,\nwe propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality.\nTo do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response\n(precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter\nrepresenting a user's preferred response length (recall).\n  Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating\nperformance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced\nhuman annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement\ncases, SAFE wins 76% of the time.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular,\nwe show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by\n$\\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here,\n$\\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number\nof learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of\ntoken quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19\nclassification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense\ntasks. The results demonstrate that the visual tokens obtained by HOOK\ncorrespond to individual objects, which demonstrates homogeneity. HOOK\noutperformed Patch Embed by 6\\% and 10\\% in the two tasks and achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to the baselines used for comparison.\nCompared to Patch Embed, which requires more than one hundred tokens for one\nimage, HOOK requires only 6 and 8 tokens for sparse and dense tasks,\nrespectively, resulting in efficiency improvements of 1.5 to 2.8 times.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, proposed a\nstandard method for ET0 computation (FAO56PM), based on the parameterization of\nthe Penman-Monteith equation, that is widely adopted in the literature. To\ncompute ET0 using the FAO56-PM method, four main weather parameters are needed:\ntemperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation (SR). One way to make daily\nET0 estimations for future days is to use freely available weather forecast\nservices (WFSs), where many meteorological parameters are estimated up to the\nnext 15 days. A problem with this method is that currently, SR is not provided\nas a free forecast parameter on most of those online services or, normally,\nsuch forecasts present a financial cost penalty. For this reason, several ET0\nestimation models using machine and deep learning were developed and presented\nin the literature, that use as input features a reduced set of carefully\nselected weather parameters, that are compatible with common freely available\nWFSs. However, most studies on this topic have only evaluated model performance\nusing data from weather stations (WSs), without considering the effect of using\nweather forecast data. In this study, the performance of authors' previous\nmodels is evaluated when using weather forecast data from two online WFSs, in\nthe following scenarios: (i) direct ET0 estimation by an ANN model, and (ii)\nestimate SR by ANN model, and then use that estimation for ET0 computation,\nusing the FAO56-PM method. Employing data collected from two WFSs and a WS\nlocated in Vale do Lobo, Portugal, the latter approach achieved the best\nresult, with a coefficient of determination (R2) ranging between 0.893 and\n0.667, when considering forecasts up to 15 days.\n","authors":["Pedro J.

Existing world models are autoregressive in that they\ninterleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the\npolicy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows.\nIn this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not\nautoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass\nthrough a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion\n(PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the\naction distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random\nstates and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the\nconnections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and\nclassifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error\nfor short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For\nshort trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive\ndiffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories,\nPolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines.

In this work, we consider decision-making and probabilistic planning\nin stochastic systems modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs), given a\npartially ordered preference over a set of temporally extended goals.\nSpecifically, each temporally extended goal is expressed using a formula in\nLinear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces (LTL$_f$). To plan with the partially\nordered preference, we introduce order theory to map a preference over temporal\ngoals to a preference over policies for the MDP. Accordingly, a most preferred\npolicy under a stochastic ordering induces a stochastic nondominated\nprobability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. To synthesize a most\npreferred policy, our technical approach includes two key steps. In the first\nstep, we develop a procedure to transform a partially ordered preference over\ntemporal goals into a computational model, called preference automaton, which\nis a semi-automaton with a partial order over acceptance conditions. In the\nsecond step, we prove that finding a most preferred policy is equivalent to\ncomputing a Pareto-optimal policy in a multi-objective MDP that is constructed\nfrom the original MDP, the preference automaton, and the chosen stochastic\nordering relation.

In recent years, imitation learning that\naims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable\nalternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning\nis designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the\nbehavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in\nimitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation\nprimarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the\nvehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is\ngoverned not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For\ninstance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on\nthe route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the\nfuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation\nlearning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model\nbut are also dependent on a cost-constrained model.

It typically involves a set of heterogeneous devices locally\ntraining neural network (NN) models in parallel with periodic centralized\naggregations. As some of the devices may have limited computational resources\nand varying availability, FL latency is highly sensitive to stragglers.\nConventional approaches discard incomplete intra-model updates done by\nstragglers, alter the amount of local workload and architecture, or resort to\nasynchronous settings; which all affect the trained model performance under\ntight training latency constraints. In this work, we propose straggler-aware\nlayer-wise federated learning (SALF) that leverages the optimization procedure\nof NNs via backpropagation to update the global model in a layer-wise fashion.\nSALF allows stragglers to synchronously convey partial gradients, having each\nlayer of the global model be updated independently with a different\ncontributing set of users. We provide a theoretical analysis, establishing\nconvergence guarantees for the global model under mild assumptions on the\ndistribution of the participating devices, revealing that SALF converges at the\nsame asymptotic rate as FL with no timing limitations.

The presented\nmethodology is based on conventional neural network-based survival models that\nare trained using data that is continuously gathered and stored at specific\ntimes, called snapshots. An important property of this type of training data is\nthat it can contain more than one snapshot from a specific individual which\nresults in that standard maximum likelihood training can not be directly\napplied since the data is not independent.

Originating in\nmodel theory, this notion is defined in terms of logic, and encompasses nowhere\ndense classes, monadically stable classes, and classes of bounded twin-width.\nWorking towards this conjecture, we provide the first two combinatorial\ncharacterizations of monadically dependent graph classes. This yields the\nfollowing dichotomy.\n  On the structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by a\nRamsey-theoretic property called flip-breakability. This notion generalizes the\nnotions of uniform quasi-wideness, flip-flatness, and bounded grid rank, which\ncharacterize nowhere denseness, monadic stability, and bounded twin-width,\nrespectively, and played a key role in their respective model checking\nalgorithms. Natural restrictions of flip-breakability additionally characterize\nbounded treewidth and cliquewidth and bounded treedepth and shrubdepth.\n  On the non-structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by explicitly\nlisting few families of forbidden induced subgraphs. This result is analogous\nto the characterization of nowhere denseness via forbidden subdivided cliques,\nand allows us to resolve one half of the motivating conjecture: First-order\nmodel checking is AW[$*$]-hard on every hereditary graph class that is\nmonadically independent. The result moreover implies that hereditary graph\nclasses which are small, have almost bounded twin-width, or have almost bounded\nflip-width, are monadically dependent.\n  Lastly, we lift our result to also obtain a combinatorial dichotomy in the\nmore general setting of monadically dependent classes of binary structures.\n","authors":["Jan Dreier","Nikolas Mählmann","Szymon Toruńczyk"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15201v2.pdf","comment":"v2: added section \"Conclusions and Future Work\""},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18646v1","updated":"2024-03-27T14:52:44Z","published":"2024-03-27T14:52:44Z","title":"Synergistic Knowledge","summary":"  In formal epistemology, group knowledge is often modelled as the knowledge\nthat the group would have, if the agents shared all their individual knowledge.\nHowever, this interpretation does not account for relations between agents.

Although data are not transmitted, edge devices have to deal with limited\ncommunication bandwidths, data heterogeneity, and straggler effects due to the\nlimited computational resources of users' devices. A prominent approach to\novercome such difficulties is FedADMM, which is based on the classical\ntwo-operator consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The\ncommon assumption of FL algorithms, including FedADMM, is that they learn a\nglobal model using data only on the users' side and not on the edge server.\nHowever, in edge learning, the server is expected to be near the base station\nand have direct access to rich datasets. In this paper, we argue that\nleveraging the rich data on the edge server is much more beneficial than\nutilizing only user datasets. Specifically, we show that the mere application\nof FL with an additional virtual user node representing the data on the edge\nserver is inefficient. We propose FedTOP-ADMM, which generalizes FedADMM and is\nbased on a three-operator ADMM-type technique that exploits a smooth cost\nfunction on the edge server to learn a global model parallel to the edge\ndevices.

One of the main goals is to support massive machine-type\ncommunications (mMTC) in the IoT applications. Supporting massive uplink (UP)\ncommunications for devices with sporadic traffic pattern and short-packet size,\nas it is in many mMTC use cases, is a challenging task, particularly when the\ncontrol signaling is not negligible in size compared to the payload. Also,\nchannel estimation is challenging for sporadic and short-packet transmission\ndue to the limited number of employed pilots. In this paper, a new UP multiple\naccess (MA) scheme is proposed for mMTC, which can support a large number of\nuncoordinated IoT devices with short-packet and sporadic traffic. The proposed\nUP MA scheme removes the overheads associated with the device identifier as\nwell as pilots related to channel estimation.

However, OTFS modulated signal has\nhigh peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) because of its precoding operation\nperformed over the DD domain. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a\nsingle-carrier transmission with delay-Doppler domain equalization (SC-DDE). In\nthis system, the discretized time-domain SC signal is converted to the DD\ndomain by discrete Zak transform (DZT) at the receiver side, followed by\ndelay-Doppler domain equalization (DDE). Since equalization is performed in the\nDD domain, the SC-DDE receiver should acquire the channel delay-Doppler\nresponse. To this end, we introduce an embedded pilot-aided channel estimation\nscheme designed for SC-DDE, which does not affect the peak power property of\ntransmitted signals. Through computer simulation, distribution of PAPR and bit\nerror rate (BER) performance of the proposed system are compared with those of\nthe conventional OTFS and SC with frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE). As a\nresult, our proposed SC-DDE significantly outperforms SC-FDE in terms of BER at\nthe expense of additional computational complexity at the receiver.\nFurthermore, SC-DDE shows much lower PAPR than OTFS even though they achieve\ncomparable coded BER performance.\n","authors":["Yuto Hama","Hideki Ochiai"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16453v1.pdf","comment":"12 pages, 10 figures, submitted to IEEE journal"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17719v1","updated":"2024-03-25T05:21:26Z","published":"2024-03-25T05:21:26Z","title":"Resolution Limit of Single-Photon LiDAR","summary":"  Single-photon Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems are often equipped\nwith an array of detectors for improved spatial resolution and sensing speed.\nHowever, given a fixed amount of flux produced by the laser transmitter across\nthe scene, the per-pixel Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) will decrease when more\npixels are packed in a unit space.

However,\ntraditional approaches, demanding static objects and fixed collisions, lead to\ndeployment limitations, operational inefficiencies, and process unreliability.\nThis paper introduces a Dynamic Bin-Picking Framework (DBPF) that challenges\ntraditional static assumptions. The DBPF endows the robot with the reactivity\nto pick multiple moving arbitrary objects while avoiding dynamic obstacles,\nsuch as the moving bin. Combined with scene-level pose generation, the proposed\npose selection metric leverages the Tendency-Aware Manipulability Network\noptimizing suction pose determination. Heuristic task-specific designs like\nvelocity-matching, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and the resight policy, enhance\nthe picking success rate and reliability. Empirical experiments demonstrate the\nimportance of these components. Our method achieves an average 84% success\nrate, surpassing the 60% of the most comparable baseline, crucially, with zero\ncollisions. Further evaluations under diverse dynamic scenarios showcase DBPF's\nrobust performance in dynamic bin-picking.

For instance, while a sentence of\nthe form $p\\wedge\\Diamond\\neg p$ ('$p$, but it might be that not $p$') appears\nto be a contradiction, $\\Diamond\\neg p$ does not entail $\\neg p$, which would\nfollow in classical logic. Likewise, the classical laws of distributivity and\ndisjunctive syllogism fail for epistemic modals. Existing attempts to account\nfor these facts generally either under- or over-correct. Some predict that\n$p\\wedge\\Diamond\\neg p$, a so-called epistemic contradiction, is a\ncontradiction only in an etiolated sense, under a notion of entailment that\ndoes not always allow us to replace $p\\wedge\\Diamond\\neg p$ with a\ncontradiction; these theories underpredict the infelicity of embedded epistemic\ncontradictions. Other theories savage classical logic, eliminating not just\nrules that intuitively fail but also rules like non-contradiction, excluded\nmiddle, De Morgan's laws, and disjunction introduction, which intuitively\nremain valid for epistemic modals. In this paper, we aim for a middle ground,\ndeveloping a semantics and logic for epistemic modals that makes epistemic\ncontradictions genuine contradictions and that invalidates distributivity and\ndisjunctive syllogism but that otherwise preserves classical laws that\nintuitively remain valid. We start with an algebraic semantics, based on\northolattices instead of Boolean algebras, and then propose a more concrete\npossibility semantics, based on partial possibilities related by compatibility.\nBoth semantics yield the same consequence relation, which we axiomatize.

On the other hand, social data, such as household\nheating composition, are closely coupled with people's lives. Studying the\ncoupling between the energy system and society is important in promoting social\nwelfare. To fill these gaps, this paper introduces two datasets. The first is\nthe main dataset for the distribution networks in Great Britain (GB),\ncollecting information on firm capacity, peak demands, locations, and parent\ntransmission nodes (the Grid Supply Point, namely GSP) for all primary\nsubstations (PSs). PSs are a crucial part of the UK distribution network and\nare at the lowest voltage level (11 kV) with publicly available data for most\nUK Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). Substation firm capacity and peak\ndemand facilitate an understanding of the remaining room of the existing\nnetwork. The parent GSP information helps link the dataset of distribution\nnetworks to datasets of transmission networks. The second dataset extends the\nmain network dataset, linking each PS to information about the number of\nhouseholds that use different types of central heating recorded in census data.\nThe derivation of the second dataset is based on locations of PSs collected in\nthe main dataset with appropriate assumptions.

Unlike traditional bit-level communication\n(BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading\nto superior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of\nSemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is\ndesired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a\nbase station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users)\nsimultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user\ninterference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit\ncoexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to\naccommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the\nsemantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact\nclosed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first\napplied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the\nresulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is\nadopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio\nproblem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further\ntransform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic\nprograms (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form\nsolution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed\npoint algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nbeamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming\nalgorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and\nweighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).\n","authors":["Maojun Zhang","Guangxu Zhu","Richeng Jin","Xiaoming Chen","Qingjiang Shi","Caijun Zhong","Kaibin Huang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11693v2.pdf","comment":"Submitted to IEEE for possible publication"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07289v3","updated":"2024-03-22T21:11:15Z","published":"2023-09-13T20:15:25Z","title":"User Training with Error Augmentation for Electromyogram-based Gesture\n  Classification","summary":"  We designed and tested a system for real-time control of a user interface by\nextracting surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity from eight electrodes in a\nwrist-band configuration. sEMG data were streamed into a machine-learning\nalgorithm that classified hand gestures in real-time.

In applications such\nas autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are\nusually passed through a \"virtual sensor\" realized by a deep learning model, to\nproduce \"measurements\" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a\ntracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are\naccumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We\nargue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information,\nand therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal\ninformation, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the\nend of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called\nMULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object,\na pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the\ninput buffer.

The learning-based detection only requires\ncounting the occurrences of the quantized outputs of -1 and +1 for estimating a\nlikelihood probability at each antenna. Accordingly, the key advantage of this\napproach is to perform maximum likelihood detection without explicit channel\nestimation which has been one of the primary challenges of one-bit quantized\nsystems. However, due to the quasi-deterministic reception in the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, one-bit observations in the high SNR regime\nare biased to either +1 or -1, and thus, the learning requires excessive\ntraining to estimate the small likelihood probabilities. To address this\ndrawback, we propose a dither-and-learning technique to estimate likelihood\nfunctions from dithered signals. First, we add a dithering signal to\nartificially decrease the SNR and then infer the likelihood function from the\nquantized dithered signals by using an SNR estimate derived from a deep neural\nnetwork-based estimator which is trained offline. We extend our technique by\ndeveloping an adaptive dither-and-learning method that updates the dithering\npower according to the patterns observed in the quantized dithered signals.

For this problem, a coded federated learning framework has been\nproposed, where the central server aggregates gradients received from the\nnon-stragglers and gradient computed from a privacy-preservation global coded\ndataset to mitigate the negative impact of the stragglers. However, when\naggregating these gradients, fixed weights are consistently applied across\niterations, neglecting the generation process of the global coded dataset and\nthe dynamic nature of the trained model over iterations. This oversight may\nresult in diminished learning performance. To overcome this drawback, we\npropose a new method named adaptive coded federated learning (ACFL). In ACFL,\nbefore the training, each device uploads a coded local dataset with additive\nnoise to the central server to generate a global coded dataset under privacy\npreservation requirements. During each iteration of the training, the central\nserver aggregates the gradients received from the non-stragglers and the\ngradient computed from the global coded dataset, where an adaptive policy for\nvarying the aggregation weights is designed. Under this policy, we optimize the\nperformance in terms of privacy and learning, where the learning performance is\nanalyzed through convergence analysis and the privacy performance is\ncharacterized via mutual information differential privacy.

However, in practice,\ntransformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a \"chain of\nthought\" or \"scratchpad\", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of\nintermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such\nintermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a\ndecoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of\nincrease depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For\ninstance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of\ndecoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard\ntransformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming a\nslight generalization to standard pre-norm, adds a clear new ability (under\nstandard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our\nresults also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within\ncontext-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm\nmake them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems --\nthe first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard\ncomplexity classes.
